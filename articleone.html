     Watching two or sometimes even three ads on Youtube before actually getting the quality you clicked for is the main reson extensions like these were created. There is a reason this is at the top of the list. Ever since downloading this extensions I have forgotten what ads on youtube or any other site for that matter looks like. For the sports fans who utilize totalsportek, for the youtube fans who hate watching upwards of 20 ads per video, for 123 movies fans who have 100 ads popping up on every click; this is the extension for you friends. It is simple and easy to integrate onto your browser, doesn't give you annoying pop ups, you can disable it for specific website for specific reasons. Provides analytics for how much work its doing for you in the background. Download this extension and you will have no pop ups, no redirections and no Jamaican women near you wanting to chat, all for $0. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me. I am sure there is no doubt in anyone's mind as to why this google chrome extension is at #1.
