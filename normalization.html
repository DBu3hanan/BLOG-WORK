        <h3>Guide To Understanding Normalization in Database Managemant</h3> 
        <br>

        Normalization is a systematic process of controlling and limiting redundancies to avoid  database anomalies.

    <h3>FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY</h3>
    <p>Function dependency is defined as a relationship between keys and non-keys in a database. Keys are also called candiate keys or primary keys. These keys are used to determine other data stored in the database. What is meant by determing? Determining is essentialy definining. For e.g. In a school system, all students have an ID number. This ID number is what is used to determine or define each student uniquely. And with that said, it is correct to assume that in a database, primary keys have to be unique to be primary keys. This key or piece of information cannot be duplicated or it will violate the primary key contraint. This value also cannot be null. Adding a primary key contraint to your key automatically adds a unique and a NOT NULL contraint to the key. Now you understand what a primary key is</p><br>

    <p>Where functional dependacy comes in is where your name, age and all other details the schoool keeps about you is determined by your ID number. The ID number is the primary key and your name is the non-key attribute. If your name and all other details are functionally dependent on your ID number only your ID number should determine all your details. Therefore if you search up your ID in the school system it must always bring up the same details. No other ID number should determine your information.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Here is an illustration</p>
    <p>RELATION ( <u>A,</u> B, C, D, E)</p>
    <p>FD: A -> B,C,D,E</p>
    <p>B, C, D, E are functionally dependent on A</p>

    <h3>FIRST NORMAL FORM (1NF)</h3>
    <p>First normal form states that every attribute in a
        relation must “be atomic” aka “have a single
        value”. You cannot have two values being held by one attribute or key. This is called a  <font color="red">multivalued attribute</font>.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>Here is an illustration</p>
        <p>Customer ( <u>customer_id</u>, First_name, Last_name,
            DOB, <font color="red">emails</font>)</p>

            <br>
        <p>This relation is in 0NF, <i>emails</i> is incorrect. We fix this by removing the offending atrribute and putting it in a table by itself along with its priamry key from the previous table</p>

        

        <p>Customer (<u>customer_id</u>, First_name, Last_name,
            dob)<br>
         Customer_Email (<u>customer_id</u>, email)</p>


         <p>Doing this will put your relation in First Normal Form (1NF)</p>


         <hr>
         <br>
    <h3>SECOND NORMAL FORM (2NF)</h3>

    <p>A relation is in Second normal form if it is already in 1NF and all non-key attributes are functional dependent on the ENTIRE COMPOSITE key and nothing but the key. But, what is a composite key. A composite key is a key that is made up of two or more keys. This combination is usually a result of a many to many relationship between entities. For those two entites to be connected a third table has to be created with both their primary keys which form, you guessed it, a composite key. Your table violates 2NF when it has a <font color="red">partial dependency</font>.<br><br>
    A partial dependency occurs when only some of the non-keys in a table are determined by the WHOLE primary key. If you have a composite key with 100 keys all attributes in that table must be determined by all 100 of the keys that make up the composite key.
    <br><br>
    <p>Here is an illustration</p>
   
    <p>Loan (<u>customer_id, loan_number</u>, DOB, amount)<br>
        FD: <u>customer_id, loan_number</u> -> amount<br>
        FD: Customer_id -> DOB</p>

    <p>In the example, DOB is only dependent on Customer_id. This is incorrect.</p>

    <br>
    <p>We fix this by removing the offending atrribute and putting it in a table by itself along with its priamry key from the previous table</p>

    <p>Loan (<u>customer_id, loan_number</u>, amount)<br>
    FD: <u>customer_id, loan_number</u> -> amount<br></p>
    


    <p>Customer (<u>customer_id</u>, DOB)<br>
    FD: <u>Customer_id</u> -> DOB</p>


    <p>If your database does not contain a coposite key it cannot violate 2NF.  </p>
        
       
        
        </p>
